In this course, students will learn how to create their own games using Roblox Studio, a powerful and user-friendly game development tool. They will also learn about programming, design, logic, problem-solving, collaboration and more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course consists of 10 lessons, each lasting 90 minutes. The lessons are:</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to Roblox Studio: Students will learn how to navigate the interface, use basic tools and commands, and explore the Roblox library of models and assets.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a 3D World: Students will learn how to create and modify terrain, add objects and materials, and adjust lighting and effects.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scripting Basics: Students will learn how to use LUA, a simple and popular programming language, to add interactivity and functionality to their games.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variables and Data Types: Students will learn how to store and manipulate data using variables, constants, operators and expressions.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Control Structures: Students will learn how to use conditional statements, loops and functions to control the flow of their code and create complex behaviors.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events and User Input: Students will learn how to use events and user input to trigger actions and responses in their games.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">GUIs and Feedback: Students will learn how to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to display information and interact with the players. They will also learn how to use sounds and particles to enhance the feedback and immersion of their games.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Mechanics and Logic: Students will learn how to design and implement core game mechanics and logic, such as scoring, health, inventory, enemies, obstacles and goals.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing and Debugging: Students will learn how to test and debug their games using various tools and techniques, such as print statements, breakpoints, error messages and logs.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishing and Sharing: Students will learn how to publish their games to the Roblox platform and share them with other users. They will also learn how to use the Roblox community features, such as groups, chat and forums.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall approach of this course is to provide students with a hands-on and project-based learning experience. Each lesson will have a clear learning objective, a step-by-step tutorial, a challenge activity and a reflection question. Students will work individually or in pairs on their own games, following the instructor's guidance and feedback. By the end of the course, students will have developed several games that showcase their creativity and skills in Roblox game design.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div class="post__bio-text"><h3><a href="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/authors/robert-rodriguez/" title="Robert Rodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__next"><a href="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/digital-dreamers-steam-academy-2/" rel="next" class="post-nav__link">Next Post<h5>Minecraft Education &amp; Coding</h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
