Coding</h1></header><div class="post__entry"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this course, students will learn how to create their own custom worlds, characters, items, and mechanics using Minecraft Education Edition and Code Builder. They will also explore various aspects of game design such as storytelling, level design, user interface, sound effects, and testing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course consists of 10 lessons, each lasting about an hour. The lessons are:</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to Minecraft Education Edition and Code Builder: Students will learn how to access and use the tools and features of Minecraft Education Edition and Code Builder. They will also learn how to create and join multiplayer worlds and collaborate with other students.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to coding with MakeCode: Students will learn the basics of coding with MakeCode, a block-based programming language that works with Minecraft. They will learn how to use variables, loops, events, functions, and commands to control their character and the world.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating custom characters: Students will learn how to create their own custom characters using the Character Creator tool. They will also learn how to use code to customize their character's appearance, abilities, and behaviors.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating custom items: Students will learn how to create their own custom items using the Item Editor tool. They will also learn how to use code to give their items special properties and effects.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating custom blocks: Students will learn how to create their own custom blocks using the Block Editor tool. They will also learn how to use code to make their blocks interactive and dynamic.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating custom biomes: Students will learn how to create their own custom biomes using the World Builder tool. They will also learn how to use code to populate their biomes with different types of blocks, plants, animals, and structures.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storytelling and narrative design: Students will learn how to use Minecraft as a storytelling platform. They will learn how to use code to create dialogue, cutscenes, quests, and choices for their players. They will also learn how to use signs, books, maps, paintings, and banners to convey information and mood.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level design and user experience: Students will learn how to design engaging and challenging levels for their players. They will learn how to use code to create puzzles, traps, obstacles, enemies, and rewards for their players. They will also learn how to use code to create user interface elements such as menus, buttons, health bars, scoreboards, and timers.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound design and music: Students will learn how to use sound and music to enhance their game. They will learn how to use code to play sound effects and music in their game. They will also learn how to use the Note Block Studio tool to create their own custom music tracks.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing and debugging: Students will learn how to test and debug their game. They will learn how to use code to monitor and modify their game variables and events. They will also learn how to use code to detect and fix errors and bugs in their game.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall approach of this course is to teach kids in STEM by letting them express their creativity and imagination through Minecraft game design. The course aims to foster a positive attitude towards STEM subjects by showing them how fun and rewarding they can be. The course also aims to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and digital literacy skills among the students.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__prev"><a href="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/digital-dreamers-steam-academy/" rel="prev" class="post-nav__link">Previous Post<h5>Roblox Game Design</h5></a></div><div class="post-nav__next"><a href="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/intro-to-arduino/" rel="next" class="post-nav__link">Next Post<h5>Intro to Arduino</h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2023, Digital Dreamers STEAM Academy.</p><p>Made with ❤️ in San Jose, CA. </p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://digitaldreamersstemacademy.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
